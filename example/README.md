This file contains examples, mostly to be used by demo.py. 

Each Python example demonstrates the setup for a search. They can be run separately from the parent directory,
e.g. as

`python -m example.p3ss`

The *.sym files are SAT instances in symbolic format and can be run, e.g. as

`python -m symsat.runsolver example/coloring.sym`
